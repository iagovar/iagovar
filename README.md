## What is this profile about

- I'm learning @ OpenBootCamp. Link to [repo](https://github.com/iagovar/openbootcamp). Link to [website](https://open-bootcamp.com/).

  I have previous experience with HTML, CSS and Python. My OpenBootCamp path is a full stack one, including SQL, JS (with node), Python (Django) and Java (with spring).
  
  I'm currently learning about the in and outs of Git.
  
  Besides the bootcamp path, I'll try to dive more into OLAP SQL with DuckDB and ClickHouse, and inferential stats.
  
- I had several websites (inclusing forums), and lately I've been interested in exploiting my databases. I've become familiar with basic SQL and ETL tools like Knime. I can use Pandas too, but not really fan of it (I find it too messy).
