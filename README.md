This is my personal repo. I have another one at [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/iagovar), mostly for private repos.

## What is this profile about

- I'm learning @ FullStackOpen. Link to [website]([https://open-bootcamp.com/](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

  I have previous experience with HTML, CSS and Python. FSO Is mostly about React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.
  
  Besides the bootcamp path, I'll try to dive more into OLAP SQL with DuckDB and ClickHouse, and inferential stats.
  
- I had several websites (inclusing forums), and lately I've been interested in exploiting my databases. I've become familiar with basic SQL and ETL tools like Knime. I can use Pandas too, but not really fan of it (I find it too messy).

## Public projects

I'm currently showcasing my public projects [in my portfolio](https://iagovar.com/).
